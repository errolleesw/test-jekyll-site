Born in the bustling city of Singapore, raised in the sun-kissed suburbs of Perth, Western Australia and now residing in the culturally rich and gastronomically diverse city Melbourne, Victoria. I have been shaped by the unique and diverse experiences of both countries.

> "You don't understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother." - Richard Feynman

Feynman's quote is not to draw similarities between you (dear reader) and my grandmother but to share a belief that deep understanding of a topic requires the ability to explain it in simple, accessible terms. This blog is a platform for me to delve deeper into the interesting things I encounter in life, by writing it down and hopefully making these topics easier to understand for the rest of the world.

In time, you will find a information on wide range of topics, from personal-growth, technology, music or the world around us. I hope you'll find something here that sparks your curiousity.

Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey and welcome to my blog.
